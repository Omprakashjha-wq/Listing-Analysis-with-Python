**Listing Analysis with Python**
This project performs an analysis of real estate listings and lead generation patterns over the first six months of 2024. The dataset includes information on listing IDs, CP codes (agents or property providers), and lead counts for each listing, categorized by month. This analysis helps identify trends in lead generation, unique listings, and active CP codes.

**Project Overview**
**This analysis provides insights into:**

**Number of leads generated per month:** Tracking the total number of leads for each month.
**Unique listings that generated leads:** Identifying the listings that successfully generated leads within each month.
**Active CP codes:** Monitoring the number of unique CP codes (agents or property providers) generating leads during the given time period.
**Key Findings**
Trends in lead generation across the first six months of 2024.
The performance of unique listings over time.
The relationship between active CP codes and leads generated each month.
Data Visualization
A bar plot is created to visualize:

Total leads per month
Unique listings with leads per month
Unique CP codes contributing to lead generation each month
<!-- Add plot image here after running the analysis and saving the plot as an image -->
